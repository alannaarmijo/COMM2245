<h2>ABOUT</h2>
	
<p>Hi my name is Alanna Armijo this is my senior year at UNM as a Liberal Arts student. This degree has been great because I consider myself a creative who is interested in having a diverse range of creative abilities and pursuing many different projects within multiple creative fields. I have experience with photography, film, design, architecture, and graphic design. I am currently designing + building out a coffee shop that plans to open later this year  in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Not only do I plan for it to be a coffee shop, but a cool creative space for people to feel welcome to hang out at and create in. My vision is to always inspire humans to create, connect, and nourish their bodies within an extraordinary space that feeds the soul and the mind.Â My mission is to be the leading provider of exceptionally crafted coffee, food, and drinks while providing a relaxed, friendly, and creative environment that ensures the highest quality products and experiences. Designing and operating a space like this is a dream and passion of mine because it allows me to let my creativity flow and flourish. Seeing a room and space come to life after carefully placing each item within it, truly brings me pure happiness and satisfaction. </p>

<h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>
<p> I am a lover of health &amp; wellness, nature, design, &amp; architecture. These elements each play a role within my minimalistic and naturalistic lifestyle. My goal is not only to improve my overall lifestyle, but help the community around me improve their lifestyle too. Most of my time is spent doing outdoor activities, doing yoga, cooking, and traveling. I began this lifestyle a few years ago after desperately needing to change my daily habits in order to feel better mentally and physically. I believe that health is wealth and become the best version of myself within this lifetime is one of my top priorities.</p>
<p> My creative goals include becoming a fully wide range and diverse artist. I still want to learn new outlets of creativity and create projects that truly bring me hapiness. I still have room for growth creatively, mentally, and physcially which will lead me to continue to push my boundaries, get out of my comfort zone, and try new things. I plan to continue creative work as a creative within the realms of photography, graphic design, product design, interior design, architecture, and art direction. I plan to explore new realms of creativity and learn outlets such as screensprinting,  film developing, ceramics, and in depth graphic design. </p>
