<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
<p>As a young student, there is much pressure to know what kind of studies you want to further pursue as you continue your education. This is a very diffcicult decision that often seems rushed and forced before  young brains are able to fully know who  they are and what they want. There are certain people who feel this connection towards pursuing what they are actually passionate about in life even if that means they have to work harder inorder to be succesful rather than pursuing a field that will make them miserable yet bring sucess financially. Usually the people who take the route of following their dreams, passions, and interests are creatives. They see the world in a different light and they feel called to contribute their talents towards the betterment of their society and the betterment of themseleves. </p>
<p>In highschool I did not know what I wanted or who I was yet, but I did know that I did not have to be pressured in pursuing something I wasn't 100% passionate about. I started to feel creatively early, by taking photos of friends on film, digital, and poloraid cameras. I began my interest in interior design just by rearanging and designing my room many many times. I was involved in the highschool's yearbook class which sparked my interest in graphic and web design. All of these sparks came from everyday life things which served as early education for my now creative lifestyle.</p>
<p>I began my young adult creative journey after enrolling in the Univeristy of New Mexico in 2019 as a Liberal Arts Major. This diverse field has offered a wide variety of education ranging from Art practices, Communication and Journalism, and Health Practices. This degree has allowed me to expand my interests and gain new practices that I am able to use outisde of my academic life in my personal and creative life. As I plan to graduate in May of 2023 with a Bachelors of Liberal Arts and Minor in Communication and Journalism, I feel content with the outlets I have explored, the experience and knowledge I have recieved, and the methods I will apply towards the future of my career.</p>

<h2>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h2>
<p>Learning is something I get to do, not have to do. As an honor student, it is important to me to continue my education and give it my full time and energy so that I am able to succeed in every course I take and truly get the most from learning. </p>
<p>Each completed and executed creative project is taken as an accomplishement. Putting myself out there to create something and execute is not something taht is taken lightly. More oppourtunitues continue to come the more this is done. I am proud to have accomplished many photography, promotional videos, brand designing, art direction, and interior design projects. </p>
