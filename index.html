  <h2>Health &amp; Creativity </h2>
	<p>When it comes to Health &amp; Creativity they work hand in hand in creating an overall healthy and balanced lifestyle. Studies confirm that being creative can increase positive emotions, lessen deprressive symptoms, reduce stress, decrease anxiety, and even improve immune system functioning. We believe that spending time on creative goals positively affects mental health and wellbeing. When people experience postive effects such as joy, happiness, and optimism they live happier and longer lives and genuinely enjoy being alive. Creative flow affects brain function, causing it to release large quantities of endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine which are pleasure and satisfaction-inducing chemicals that affect creativity and well-being. </p>
	<p>The way that the brain acts during creative activities is similar to the experience of meditation and mindfulness helping you to find peace, clarity, and hapiness. Creativity produces a natural high and feelings of contentment and satisfaction. </p>
