<h2>CREATIVE PORTFOLIO </h2>
<p>Working with brands to art direct and photograph their products are the best examples of my creative work. When planning, we come up with ideas and themes for each shoot that truly represents the brands identity. We use  props, colors, and models to truly enhance the experience of the products being  represented. The photos make the products stand out to the viewers and create an appealing affect. Each photoshoot takes planning before execution because each one is original and unique. Although our overall style is similar, each brand gets their own special theme for their shoot that is carefully crafted just for them.</p>
<p>A few brands pictured for creative work are Moments, Baggu, Glossier, Broccoli Magazine, &amp; Laundryday.</p>
<h2>PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>My overall creative style is represented through my photos. Common themes incorporated within each project is minimalism, simplicity, and naturalism as well as using natural lighting, free props, and simple backgrounds. Photography is an art in itself but it needs the art of direction to truly make it come to life. Art direction makes sure that the little details are in tact and that the vision is going to be executed properly. Pre art direction plays a big role in making sure the shoot will be organized and productive. Art direction during the shoot is just as important just in case any improv or backup plans need to occur. The time not spent taking photos is time spent looking from the outside in. </p>
